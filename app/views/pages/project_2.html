<h4>How I did project 2 </h4>
<h2>To insert the bootstrap framework into my rails project, I navigated to my project directory and opened the gemfile. <br>
	<br>Using a text editor, I added the following line to the gemfile: <br>

	<br><myCode>gem 'bootstrap-sass', '2.3.2.0'</myCode></br>

	<br>Next, I ran the command, </br>
	<br><myCode>bundle install</myCode></br>
